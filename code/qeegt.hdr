function qeegt(eeg_fname, state, lwin, fmin, freqres, fmax, wbands, brain, pg_apply, flags, output_folder)

% eeg_fname: File which contains the EEG data in PLG (Neuronic) format. Does mot include extension
% state:     EEG state to be selected for calculations
% lwin:      Length of epochs, in seconds. Example: 2.56 seg
% fmin:      Low cut frequency for analysis
% freqres:   Frequency resolution for analysis
% fmax:      High cut frequency for analysis
% wbands:    Broad Bands definition in string format. For example:
%                 wbands='1.56 3.51; 3.9 7.41; 7.8 12.48; 12.87 19.11; 1.56 11';
% brain:     1 indicates to restrict the inverse solution to only gray matter
% pg_apply:  1 indicates to apply correction by the General Scale Factor
%flags: Options for calculations in string format. For example:
%       flags='1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1';
%  flags(1)- 1 for calculating the Broad Band Spectral Model
%  flags(2)- 1 for calculating the Narrow Band Spectral Model
%  flags(3)- 1 for calculating the Spectra at the EEG sources
%  flags(4)- RESERVED, not used
%  flags(5)- 1 for calculating the Broad Band Spectral Model Z values
%  flags(6)- 1 for calculating the Narrow Band Spectral Model Z values
%  flags(7)- 1 for calculating the Sources Spectra Z values
%  flags(8)- 1 for calculating the correlations matrix bewteen all pairs of channels for each epoch
%  flags(9)- 1 for calculating the coherence matrix bewteen all pairs of channels for each frequency
% flags(10)- 1 for calculating the phase difference matrix bewteen all pairs of channels for each frequency
% flags(11)- 1 for calculating the frequency domain correlations bewteen all pairs of channels for each frequency and each epoch
% flags(12)- Store the XYZ components of the solutions at the sources
% output_folder: Folder name where to store the results. It should end with the folder separation character.
%            If empty, the results are saved in the same directory as the input data
%%%%%%%% NEW %%%%%%%%%%
% eeg_fname: can also be the name of an ASCII file (with a fixed structure)
% which contains the data of an EEG recording. In that case, the file needs to
% have the extension ".txt" and must have the following structure:
% NAME=Jane Doe
% SEX=F
% AGE=20.94
% SAMPLING_FREQ=200
% EPOCH_SIZE=512
% NCHANNELS=19
% MONTAGE=
% Fp1-REF
% Fp2-REF
% F3_-REF
%and so on. The program expects NCHANNELS lines with the names
%AFTER THE CHANNELS NAMES, THE EEG DATA
%where each line is an instant of time and each column represents a channel.
%If the EEG contains 30 segments of 512 points each and 19 channels, then
%30*512 lines of 19 columns of numbers (either float or integer) are expected
